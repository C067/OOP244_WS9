Reflection:

1. No the source code will not compile because we can not put a template function
into a .cpp file. The reason for this is because when we create a template function
the templated is converted into a class implementaion. 

2. Even if you move one of the templated functions into the main file ws9_lab.cpp either 
above or below the main function the template will still not work. The reason for 
this is because it is unidentifed; meaning, the function is represented as a class
not as a implementation. 

3. Yes this lab could have been done by overloading the functions but the only way for
that to work is to have seperate overloaded functions to accept either integers as an argument 
or a double as an arguement. The advantage of using a template function is that by using 
<typename T> T can be used as a return value for any type. 

4. Yes they are both equivalent because both methods convert the template into a class
representing both methods as a class templates. Both methods are also used to represent/
identifiy any type.
